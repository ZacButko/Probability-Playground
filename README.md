# Probability Playground

Welcome!

Included in this repo are several project playing with probability. Usually the questions revolve around answering a question about a game; "should I do this? or this other move instead?" Here we find the answers! and in the process look at some fun ways to visualize and interpret the results

The role playing game 'Star Wars' has special dice; instead of having sides with numbers 1-N, they instead have two different mechanics "Success" and "Advantage" with varying prevalance on each side shown.

In progressing one's character in the game the player has a choice, substitute one of three d8 dice for a d12, or add one d6 to your pool of three d8. We maximizing for both mechanics and plot the results on an at-least graph, showing the advantage of picking up an extra dice instead of subsituting

## <a href='https://github.com/ZacButko/Probability-Playground/tree/master/Warfish%20Dice'>Warfish Dice</a>

The web-based game Warfish is much like the classic "Risk". On your turn you get a certain amount of troops with which you can try attacking other players' territories and taking them for your empire. The attack mechanic is usually at the crux of any strategy, so maximizing it is imperative. We explore several ways to conceptualize remaining probability after successive losses (or wins!), and look at how this changes when defender has extra advantage (+1 or higher) to their rolls
